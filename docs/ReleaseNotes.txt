AOCL-LibMem is a library of the most widely used string/memory functions of
C library optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture.
This library supports both static and dynamic/shared builds.
The shared library should be LD_PRELOAD'ed by the application to replace standard
string/memory functions for better performance gains on AMD Zen microarchitectures.
a) Default build picks the best-fit implementation based on the
underlying micro-architectural support.
b) Tunable build lets the user choose a specific implementation based on the
tunables parameters.
